# Welcome

I'm Sean Kim, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, working under the supervision of Professor Salvatore Salamone. My research focuses on structural health monitoring, developing innovative machine learning approaches to detect and predict damage in civil infrastructure and mechanical systems.

## Research Interests

- **Structural Health Monitoring**: Real-time damage detection and assessment in infrastructure
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Developing algorithms for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance
- **Signal Processing**: Analysis of sensor data from structural monitoring systems
- **Data Science**: Large-scale sensor data analysis and visualization

## Recent Work

I'm currently working on several exciting projects involving deep learning applications for structural damage detection, predictive maintenance algorithms, and developing novel sensor fusion techniques for infrastructure monitoring.
