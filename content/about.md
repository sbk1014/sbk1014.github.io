# About Me

I'm Sean Kim, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, working in Professor Salvatore Salamone's research group. My academic journey has led me to explore how machine learning and advanced signal processing techniques can revolutionize structural health monitoring and infrastructure maintenance.

## Education & Background

I have a strong foundation in engineering, computer science, and data analytics, which allows me to bridge the gap between traditional structural engineering and modern AI-driven approaches. My interdisciplinary background enables me to tackle complex problems in infrastructure monitoring that require both engineering expertise and computational skills.

## Research Philosophy

I believe in developing practical, deployable solutions that can make our infrastructure safer and more resilient. My work focuses on creating accessible tools and methods that can be implemented in real-world structural monitoring systems to prevent failures and optimize maintenance strategies.

## Current Focus

My current research involves:
- Developing deep learning models for damage detection and localization
- Creating algorithms for real-time structural health assessment
- Exploring applications of computer vision in infrastructure monitoring
- Building predictive maintenance systems using sensor fusion techniques
- Advancing non-destructive testing methods with AI
