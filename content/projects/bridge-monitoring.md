## Overview

Developing an intelligent monitoring system that uses deep learning and sensor fusion to detect structural damage in bridges in real-time, enabling predictive maintenance and preventing catastrophic failures.

## Key Achievements

- Implemented deep learning models for anomaly detection with 98% accuracy
- Reduced false positive rates by 75% compared to traditional threshold-based methods
- Developed a real-time dashboard for infrastructure managers
- Successfully deployed on 3 pilot bridges in Texas

## Technologies Used

- Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for deep learning models
- MATLAB for signal processing and modal analysis
- Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming
- Docker/Kubernetes for scalable deployment
- Accelerometer, strain gauge, and acoustic emission sensors

## Impact

This project has the potential to save millions in maintenance costs while significantly improving public safety by detecting structural issues before they become critical. The system provides 24/7 monitoring capabilities with automated alert systems for infrastructure managers.
