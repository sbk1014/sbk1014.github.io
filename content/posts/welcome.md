Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my research and insights on structural health monitoring, machine learning applications in civil engineering, and the future of smart infrastructure.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:
- Latest advances in structural health monitoring
- Machine learning techniques for damage detection
- Real-world case studies from our research projects
- Signal processing and sensor fusion methods
- Infrastructure resilience and predictive maintenance
- Open-source tools and datasets for the SHM community
